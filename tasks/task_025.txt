# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Personalized Event Recommendation Engine for Inactive User Segments
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a personalized recommendation engine that suggests optimal event types and reward sizes for inactive user segments, leveraging the user segmentation results from Task #18.
# Details:
This task involves creating a recommendation engine that targets inactive users with personalized event suggestions to improve re-engagement. Implementation should include:

1. Data Integration:
   - Connect to the user segmentation data from Task #18
   - Integrate historical event participation and response data
   - Establish data pipelines for real-time or batch processing

2. Recommendation Algorithm Development:
   - Implement collaborative filtering techniques to identify patterns in user preferences
   - Develop content-based filtering for matching event types to user profiles
   - Create a hybrid recommendation approach combining multiple techniques
   - Implement machine learning models to predict optimal reward sizes based on user value segments

3. Personalization Features:
   - Design user profile enrichment to capture preferences and behaviors
   - Implement contextual awareness (time, location, past behavior)
   - Create a scoring system for ranking recommendations

4. System Architecture:
   - Design a scalable architecture that can handle recommendation requests
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
   - Ensure low latency for real-time recommendations
   - Create API endpoints for integration with notification systems

5. Feedback Loop:
   - Implement tracking mechanisms to measure recommendation effectiveness
   - Design a system to incorporate user responses into future recommendations
   - Create A/B testing framework to compare recommendation strategies

6. Documentation:
   - Document the recommendation algorithm logic and parameters
   - Create API documentation for system integration
   - Provide configuration guides for tuning recommendation parameters

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this recommendation engine should be comprehensive and include:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test individual components of the recommendation algorithm
   - Verify correct handling of edge cases (new users, users with limited history)
   - Test data processing and transformation functions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify correct integration with user segmentation data from Task #18
   - Test API endpoints for proper request/response handling
   - Ensure proper data flow between system components

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure recommendation generation time under various loads
   - Test system scalability with increasing user numbers
   - Verify caching mechanisms are working as expected

4. Accuracy Testing:
   - Create a test dataset with known preferences and verify recommendation quality
   - Implement precision and recall metrics for recommendation evaluation
   - Compare algorithm performance against baseline random recommendations

5. A/B Testing Framework:
   - Verify the A/B testing system correctly assigns users to test groups
   - Test the statistical significance calculation for recommendation performance
   - Ensure proper tracking of conversion metrics

6. Offline Evaluation:
   - Perform historical data analysis to validate recommendation quality
   - Use cross-validation techniques to assess model generalization
   - Calculate expected lift in engagement metrics

7. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create a sandbox environment for stakeholders to review recommendations
   - Gather feedback on recommendation quality and relevance
   - Verify business requirements are met

Success criteria: The system should demonstrate at least a 15% improvement in re-engagement rates for inactive users compared to non-personalized approaches in controlled tests.
