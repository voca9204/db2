  "priority": "high",
  "details": "Migrate authentication functionality to Firebase Authentication as part of the Firebase Functions migration:\n\n1. Firebase Authentication Integration:\n   - Migrate authentication from src/utils/auth.py to Firebase Authentication\n   - Implement email/password, Google account, and custom token authentication\n   - Convert session management to Firebase token-based authentication\n   - Implement JWT token validation and authentication state persistence\n\n2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):\n   - Define user roles using Firebase Authentication Custom Claims\n   - Implement granular roles: Admin, Analyst, User, etc.\n   - Implement data access control using Firestore security rules\n   - Create permission verification middleware for API endpoints\n\n3. API Security Enhancement:\n   - Apply authentication middleware to Firebase Functions HTTP triggers\n   - Convert API key authentication to JWT token-based authentication\n   - Implement rate limiting and request validation\n   - Configure CORS and security headers\n\n4. Activity Logging and Auditing:\n   - Configure Firebase Authentication activity logs\n   - Store user activity logs in Firestore\n   - Implement security event detection and notifications using Cloud Functions\n   - Create audit log analysis and dashboard\n   - Generate daily security reports with authentication and API access statistics\n   - Provide admin interfaces for log searching and analysis\n\n5. Migration Strategy:\n   - Migrate existing user accounts to Firebase Authentication\n   - Support both existing and new authentication during transition\n   - Transfer user role and permission information\n   - Update authentication token issuance and validation systems\n\nImplemented so far:\n- Firebase Authentication initial setup and integration\n- OAuth provider (Google) authentication integration\n- Basic role-based access control implementation\n- Authentication middleware for Firebase Functions HTTP triggers\n- Email/password-based account management\n- Authentication middleware for API endpoints with role-based access control\n- Rate limiting middleware to prevent API abuse\n- Security headers and CORS configuration for API endpoints\n- Activity logging middleware for tracking user actions\n- Security event detection for abnormal login patterns\n- Daily security report generation via scheduled Cloud Functions",
  "testStrategy": "Create tests in tests/utils/test_auth.py and tests/firebase/test_auth.py to verify:\n- Proper authentication with Firebase Authentication\n- Correct JWT token validation and handling\n- Role-based permission checking with Custom Claims\n- Rejection of invalid credentials\n- Firestore security rules effectiveness\n- Activity logging in Firestore\n- Migration of user accounts from existing system to Firebase\n- Rate limiting functionality and request throttling\n- Security headers and CORS configuration effectiveness\n- API middleware authentication and authorization\n- Security event detection and alerting functionality\n- Daily security report generation accuracy\n- Audit log API endpoints functionality and access control\n\nUse Firebase Local Emulator Suite for testing Firebase Authentication and Firestore security rules.",
