  "title": "Implement Inactive User Re-engagement Campaign Management System",
  "description": "Develop a comprehensive system to manage the entire lifecycle of re-engagement campaigns targeting inactive users, including user selection, campaign design, execution, monitoring, and results analysis with an automated workflow.",
  "details": "The Inactive User Re-engagement Campaign Management System should be implemented with the following components and features:\n\n1. User Selection Module:\n   - Integration with user database to identify and segment inactive users based on configurable criteria (e.g., days since last login, incomplete transactions)\n   - Advanced filtering capabilities to create targeted user segments\n   - Leverage data from Task 19's personalization system to identify optimal user segments\n\n2. Campaign Design Interface:\n   - Intuitive UI for creating and configuring campaigns with customizable templates\n   - Event type selection with reward structure design tools\n   - Integration with Task 19's recommendation system to suggest optimal event types and reward sizes\n   - A/B test configuration capabilities with statistical significance calculators\n\n3. Campaign Execution Engine:\n   - Automated scheduling and deployment of campaigns\n   - Multi-channel delivery system (email, push notifications, in-app messages)\n   - Throttling and pacing controls to prevent user fatigue\n   - Fallback mechanisms for failed deliveries\n\n4. Monitoring Dashboard:\n   - Real-time visualization of campaign performance metrics\n   - Integration with Task 20's monitoring system for KPI tracking\n   - Alert system for underperforming campaigns\n   - Comparative analysis tools to benchmark against historical campaigns\n\n5. Analysis and Optimization Module:\n   - Post-campaign analysis with detailed conversion metrics\n   - ROI calculator for campaign investments\n   - Machine learning-based optimization suggestions\n   - Automated report generation with actionable insights\n\n6. Administration System:\n   - Role-based access control for campaign management\n   - Audit logging for compliance and security\n   - Configuration management for system parameters\n   - Integration with existing authentication systems\n\nTechnical Implementation Considerations:\n- Use a microservices architecture to ensure scalability of individual components\n- Implement event-driven design for real-time processing\n- Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance for all user targeting\n- Design for high throughput to handle millions of users\n- Implement caching strategies for performance optimization\n- Use containerization for deployment flexibility",
  "testStrategy": "The testing strategy for the Inactive User Re-engagement Campaign Management System will include:\n\n1. Unit Testing:\n   - Test each component in isolation with mock dependencies\n   - Achieve at least 85% code coverage\n   - Implement automated unit tests for all business logic\n   - Validate edge cases for user selection algorithms\n\n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Verify correct integration with Task 19's recommendation system\n   - Test data flow between Task 20's monitoring system and the dashboard\n   - Validate database interactions for user selection and campaign storage\n   - Test notification delivery systems with mock external services\n\n3. Performance Testing:\n   - Load test the system with simulated data for 10+ million users\n   - Measure response times for dashboard rendering under heavy load\n   - Verify campaign execution engine can handle 100+ simultaneous campaigns\n   - Test database query performance for large user segments\n\n4. User Acceptance Testing:\n   - Create test scenarios for marketing team to validate workflow\n   - Verify dashboard usability with actual stakeholders\n   - Conduct A/B test simulations with predefined outcomes\n   - Validate reporting accuracy against manually calculated metrics\n\n5. End-to-End Testing:\n   - Execute complete campaign lifecycle tests in staging environment\n   - Verify all system components work together correctly\n   - Test recovery from simulated failures\n   - Validate data consistency across the entire workflow\n\n6. Security Testing:\n   - Perform penetration testing on all user interfaces\n   - Validate role-based access controls\n   - Test for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS)\n   - Verify proper encryption of sensitive user data\n\n7. Acceptance Criteria:\n   - System can successfully execute a campaign from creation to analysis\n   - Dashboard accurately displays all required KPIs in real-time\n   - A/B testing functionality produces statistically valid results\n   - Optimization suggestions are actionable and relevant\n   - All integrations with Task 19 and Task 20 function correctly\n   - System meets performance requirements under expected load",
