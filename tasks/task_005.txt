# Task ID: 5
# Title: Query Execution and Management Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a module for executing SQL queries against the database with performance tracking, parameterization, and result management.
# Details:
Create src/database/query_manager.py with functionality to:
- Execute SQL queries with parameter binding
- Measure and log query execution time
- Handle query results (conversion to Pandas DataFrame, etc.)
- Manage query templates and parameterization
- Implement query caching for performance
- Handle large result sets efficiently

Implement the following structure:
```python
class QueryManager:
    def __init__(self, db_connection):
        self.connection = db_connection
        self.query_cache = {}
        self.performance_log = []
    
    def execute_query(self, query, params=None, use_cache=True):
        # Execute query with parameters
        # Track execution time
        # Return results as appropriate data structure
        pass
    
    def execute_from_file(self, file_path, params=None):
        # Load query from file and execute
        pass
    
    def load_query_template(self, template_name):
        # Load query template from queries directory
        pass
    
    def get_performance_stats(self, query_pattern=None):
        # Get performance statistics for queries
        pass
```

Organize SQL query files in the queries/ directory by category (user/, event/, schema/).

# Test Strategy:
Create tests in tests/database/test_query_manager.py to verify:
- Correct query execution and result handling
- Parameter binding security (SQL injection prevention)
- Performance tracking accuracy
- Caching functionality
- Large result set handling
Use mock database responses for testing.
