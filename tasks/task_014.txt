# Task ID: 14
# Title: Data Export and Sharing Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a module for exporting analysis results and reports in various formats and sharing them with other users or systems.
# Details:
Create src/utils/export.py with functionality to:
- Export data in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Generate shareable links for reports and dashboards
- Schedule automatic exports
- Implement email delivery of reports
- Support API access to data

Implement the following structure:
```python
class DataExporter:
    def __init__(self, auth_system=None):
        self.auth_system = auth_system
    
    def export_data(self, data, format='csv', filename=None):
        # Export data in specified format
        pass
    
    def generate_share_link(self, resource_id, expiration=None, permissions=None):
        # Generate shareable link with optional expiration
        pass
    
    def schedule_export(self, data_source, parameters, format, schedule, recipients=None):
        # Schedule automatic export
        pass
    
    def send_email(self, recipients, subject, body, attachments=None):
        # Send email with optional attachments
        pass
    
    def create_api_endpoint(self, data_source, parameters, auth_required=True):
        # Create API endpoint for data access
        pass
```

Integrate with email service (SMTP or third-party API) for delivery.

# Test Strategy:
Create tests in tests/utils/test_export.py to verify:
- Correct export in different formats
- Proper link generation and validation
- Scheduling functionality
- Email sending (using mock service)
- API endpoint creation and access control
Use sample data for testing exports.
