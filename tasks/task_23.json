  "description": "Fix Firebase Functions deployment issues related to SDK and Node.js version mismatches, and complete the migration of the High-Value User Analysis Report to Firebase Functions.",
  "details": "This task involves two main components:\n\n1. Firebase Functions Deployment Issue Resolution:\n   - Address the warning about Firebase Functions SDK version 4.9.0 not being the latest\n   - Resolve Node.js version mismatch (requested version 18, global version 23)\n   - Update package.json to specify the correct Node.js engine version\n   - Update Firebase Functions SDK to the latest compatible version\n   - Check for any dependencies that might be causing conflicts\n   - Review and update deployment configuration in firebase.json\n   - Ensure all environment variables are properly set in the deployment environment\n   - Test deployment in a staging environment before proceeding to production\n\n2. High-Value User Analysis Report Migration:\n   - Complete the migration of \"3.1 고가치사용자 종합분석보고서\" (High-Value User Comprehensive Analysis Report) from index.html to Firebase Functions\n   - Ensure all data processing logic is properly implemented in the Functions\n   - Verify that the report data is correctly fetched and processed\n   - Implement proper error handling and logging\n   - Optimize the function for performance, considering cold start times\n   - Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place\n   - Update any frontend code that consumes this report to use the new Functions endpoint\n\nThis task builds upon the work done in Task #22 and aims to finalize both the deployment process and the migration of a critical business report.",
  "testStrategy": "Testing should be conducted in the following stages:\n\n1. Firebase Functions Deployment Testing:\n   - Create a checklist of all version-related issues identified\n   - Verify SDK version has been updated by checking package.json and node_modules\n   - Confirm Node.js version compatibility by testing with the specified version (18)\n   - Perform a test deployment to a development environment\n   - Check Firebase deployment logs for any remaining warnings or errors\n   - Verify that all functions are properly registered and accessible\n   - Test cold start performance of the deployed functions\n\n2. High-Value User Report Migration Testing:\n   - Create test cases covering all functionality of the original report\n   - Compare output data from the original implementation with the new Functions-based implementation\n   - Test with various input parameters and edge cases\n   - Verify response times are within acceptable limits\n   - Test error scenarios to ensure proper error handling\n   - Perform load testing to ensure the function can handle expected traffic\n   - Verify authentication and authorization are working correctly\n   - Conduct end-to-end testing with the frontend to ensure proper integration\n\n3. Documentation and Validation:\n   - Document all changes made to resolve deployment issues\n   - Update deployment procedures documentation\n   - Create a migration report comparing the original and new implementations\n   - Get stakeholder sign-off on the migrated report functionality\n   - Monitor the deployed functions for 24-48 hours after deployment to catch any issues",
