# Task ID: 8
# Title: Data Visualization Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop reusable visualization components for charts, graphs, and tables to display analysis results, with a focus on inactive user event effect analysis.
# Details:
Create visualization components in the src/visualization/ directory with functionality to:
- Generate various chart types (line, bar, pie, scatter, etc.)
- Create interactive visualizations using Plotly and Dash
- Format tables for data display with search, sorting, and filtering capabilities
- Support customizable styling and theming
- Enable export to various formats (PNG, PDF, SVG)

Implemented components include:
1. src/visualization/inactive_event_dashboard.py - Dash-based dashboard implementation
2. src/visualization/assets/dashboard.css - Dashboard styling definitions
3. scripts/run_dashboard.py - Dashboard execution script

The dashboard provides the following visualization features:
- Conversion rate by inactive period (bar chart)
- Conversion rate by event amount (bar chart)
- ROI trend graph (line chart)
- Converted user data table (with search, sort, and filtering functionality)
- Summary statistics cards

Original planned structure for components.py:
```python
class VisualizationComponents:
    def __init__(self, theme=None):
        self.theme = theme or self._default_theme()
    
    def _default_theme(self):
        # Define default styling theme
        pass
    
    def line_chart(self, data, x_column, y_columns, title=None, **kwargs):
        # Generate line chart
        pass
    
    def bar_chart(self, data, x_column, y_columns, title=None, **kwargs):
        # Generate bar chart
        pass
    
    def pie_chart(self, data, value_column, label_column, title=None, **kwargs):
        # Generate pie chart
        pass
    
    def table(self, data, columns=None, formatting=None, **kwargs):
        # Generate formatted table
        pass
    
    def export_figure(self, figure, filename, format='png'):
        # Export visualization to file
        pass
```

Create additional specialized visualization modules in src/visualization/ directory for specific analysis types as needed.

# Test Strategy:
Create tests in tests/visualization/ to verify:
- Correct rendering of different chart types in the inactive user dashboard
- Proper handling of different data formats
- Styling and theming application
- Interactive features of the dashboard (filtering, sorting, etc.)
- Dashboard responsiveness and layout

Specifically test:
- tests/visualization/test_inactive_event_dashboard.py to verify dashboard components
- tests/visualization/test_dashboard_integration.py to verify end-to-end functionality

Use sample datasets for testing and compare visual output against expected results.
