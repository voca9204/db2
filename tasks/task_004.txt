# Task ID: 4
# Title: Database Variable Documentation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to define and document the meaning of database variables, fields, and their relationships to support analysis and reporting.
# Details:
Create src/database/variable_documentation.py to:
- Define a structured format for variable documentation
- Create a system to store and retrieve variable definitions
- Link variables to their usage in queries and reports
- Support tagging and categorization of variables
- Enable search and filtering of variable definitions

Implement the following structure:
```python
class VariableDocumentation:
    def __init__(self, db_connection):
        self.connection = db_connection
        self.variables = {}
    
    def load_definitions(self, source_file=None):
        # Load variable definitions from file or database
        pass
    
    def add_definition(self, variable_name, definition, metadata=None):
        # Add or update variable definition
        pass
    
    def get_definition(self, variable_name):
        # Retrieve variable definition
        pass
    
    def export_definitions(self, output_format='markdown'):
        # Export all definitions to specified format
        pass
    
    def search_definitions(self, query):
        # Search definitions by keyword
        pass
```

Create a documentation template in docs/database/variable_template.md
Implement storage in either database or structured files in docs/database/variables/

# Test Strategy:
Write tests in tests/database/test_variable_documentation.py to verify:
- Proper storage and retrieval of variable definitions
- Correct formatting of documentation
- Search functionality
- Export capabilities
Test with a sample set of variable definitions.
