# Task ID: 13
# Title: User Authentication and Access Control
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a system for user authentication, authorization, and access control to protect sensitive data and functionality by integrating with Firebase Authentication.
# Details:
Migrate authentication functionality to Firebase Authentication as part of the Firebase Functions migration:

1. Firebase Authentication Integration:
   - Migrate authentication from src/utils/auth.py to Firebase Authentication
   - Implement email/password, Google account, and custom token authentication
   - Convert session management to Firebase token-based authentication
   - Implement JWT token validation and authentication state persistence

2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   - Define user roles using Firebase Authentication Custom Claims
   - Implement granular roles: Admin, Analyst, User, etc.
   - Implement data access control using Firestore security rules
   - Create permission verification middleware for API endpoints

3. API Security Enhancement:
   - Apply authentication middleware to Firebase Functions HTTP triggers
   - Convert API key authentication to JWT token-based authentication
   - Implement rate limiting and request validation
   - Configure CORS and security headers

4. Activity Logging and Auditing:
   - Configure Firebase Authentication activity logs
   - Store user activity logs in Firestore
   - Implement security event detection and notifications using Cloud Functions
   - Create audit log analysis and dashboard
   - Generate daily security reports with authentication and API access statistics
   - Provide admin interfaces for log searching and analysis

5. Migration Strategy:
   - Migrate existing user accounts to Firebase Authentication
   - Support both existing and new authentication during transition
   - Transfer user role and permission information
   - Update authentication token issuance and validation systems

Implemented so far:
- Firebase Authentication initial setup and integration
- OAuth provider (Google) authentication integration
- Basic role-based access control implementation
- Authentication middleware for Firebase Functions HTTP triggers
- Email/password-based account management
- Authentication middleware for API endpoints with role-based access control
- Rate limiting middleware to prevent API abuse
- Security headers and CORS configuration for API endpoints
- Activity logging middleware for tracking user actions
- Security event detection for abnormal login patterns
- Daily security report generation via scheduled Cloud Functions

# Test Strategy:
Create tests in tests/utils/test_auth.py and tests/firebase/test_auth.py to verify:
- Proper authentication with Firebase Authentication
- Correct JWT token validation and handling
- Role-based permission checking with Custom Claims
- Rejection of invalid credentials
- Firestore security rules effectiveness
- Activity logging in Firestore
- Migration of user accounts from existing system to Firebase
- Rate limiting functionality and request throttling
- Security headers and CORS configuration effectiveness
- API middleware authentication and authorization
- Security event detection and alerting functionality
- Daily security report generation accuracy
- Audit log API endpoints functionality and access control

Use Firebase Local Emulator Suite for testing Firebase Authentication and Firestore security rules.
