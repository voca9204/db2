Interactive Reporting UI Enhancement:\n   - Develop interactive table components with sorting, filtering, and pagination\n   - Implement advanced visualization components (charts, graphs, heatmaps)\n   - Create responsive dashboard layouts for different screen sizes\n   - Ensure accessibility compliance for all new UI components\n\n4. Caching Mechanism Implementation:\n   - Design a multi-level caching strategy (memory, disk, distributed)\n   - Implement cache invalidation and refresh policies\n   - Add cache monitoring and statistics collection\n   - Optimize cache usage based on query patterns and data access frequency\n\nImplementation Considerations:\n- Maintain compatibility with existing systems through adapter patterns or facade interfaces\n- Use feature flags to enable gradual rollout and minimize system disruption\n- Implement comprehensive logging for performance metrics collection\n- Focus on user experience improvements with intuitive interfaces and responsive design\n- Document all new components and APIs thoroughly for future maintenance",
  "testStrategy": "The testing strategy will verify both functional correctness and performance improvements:\n\n1. Unit Testing:\n   - Test MariaDB connector methods with mock database responses\n   - Verify query builder/ORM functionality with test cases covering simple and complex queries\n   - Test UI components in isolation with component testing frameworks\n   - Validate caching mechanisms with controlled cache scenarios\n\n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Test database connector integration with existing application code\n   - Verify analysis tools integration with real database instances\n   - Test UI components interaction with backend APIs\n   - Validate caching behavior in integrated environments\n\n3. Performance Testing:\n   - Establish baseline performance metrics before implementation\n   - Measure query execution times before and after connector implementation\n   - Test system performance under various load conditions\n   - Measure cache hit/miss rates and response time improvements\n   - Conduct stress tests to identify bottlenecks\n\n4. User Experience Testing:\n   - Conduct usability testing with representative users\n   - Collect feedback on new UI components and visualizations\n   - Measure task completion times for common analysis workflows\n   - Evaluate user satisfaction with new reporting capabilities\n\n5. Regression Testing:\n   - Verify that existing functionality continues to work correctly\n   - Test backward compatibility with legacy code and interfaces\n   - Ensure data integrity is maintained during and after migration\n\n6. Acceptance Criteria:\n   - Query execution time improved by at least 30% for complex queries\n   - Analysis capabilities support at least 5 new types of data visualizations\n   - UI response time for data-heavy reports improved by at least 50%\n   - Cache hit rate of at least 80% for frequently accessed data\n   - No regression in existing functionality\n   - Positive user feedback on new analysis and reporting capabilities",
