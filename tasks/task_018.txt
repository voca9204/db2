# Task ID: 18
# Title: Inactive User Targeting System Development
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system that identifies and targets inactive users with high potential for re-engagement and conversion through events, leveraging existing user behavior and event effect analysis modules.
# Details:
This task involves creating a comprehensive system to identify and target inactive users who have a high probability of returning to the game and making deposits when presented with appropriate events. The system should:

1. Integrate with the User Behavior Analysis Module (Task 6) to access historical user activity data, engagement patterns, and previous conversion metrics.
2. Utilize the Event Effect Analysis Module (Task 7) to understand which events have been most effective for different user segments.
3. Develop user segmentation algorithms that categorize inactive users based on their historical behavior, spending patterns, and engagement history.
4. Create a predictive model that calculates the probability of an inactive user responding to specific event types.
5. Implement a scoring system that ranks inactive users by their potential value upon re-engagement (considering factors like previous spending, social influence, etc.).
6. Design an automated targeting mechanism that matches high-potential inactive users with the most effective event types for their segment.
7. Develop a dashboard for monitoring the effectiveness of the targeting system, including metrics like re-engagement rate, conversion rate, and ROI.
8. Implement A/B testing capabilities to continuously refine the targeting algorithms.
9. Create an API for integration with existing marketing and notification systems.
10. Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and implement appropriate data handling protocols.

The system should be designed with scalability in mind to handle large user databases and provide real-time or near-real-time targeting recommendations.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this system should be comprehensive and multi-faceted:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test individual components of the system (segmentation algorithms, prediction models, scoring system) with known test data.
   - Verify correct integration with Task 6 and Task 7 modules through mock interfaces.
   - Validate the accuracy of the prediction models using historical data.

2. Integration Testing:
   - Ensure proper data flow between all components of the system.
   - Verify that the system correctly retrieves and processes data from the User Behavior Analysis and Event Effect Analysis modules.
   - Test the API endpoints for correct functionality and error handling.

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark the system with large datasets to ensure it can handle the expected user base.
   - Measure response times for generating targeting recommendations.
   - Test the system under various load conditions to identify bottlenecks.

4. Validation Testing:
   - Conduct a controlled pilot test with a subset of inactive users to validate the effectiveness of the targeting system.
   - Compare re-engagement and conversion rates between targeted users and a control group.
   - Calculate the precision and recall of the prediction model using real-world results.

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have marketing and product teams review the dashboard and targeting recommendations.
   - Verify that the system provides actionable insights that align with business objectives.

6. A/B Testing Framework Validation:
   - Verify that the A/B testing mechanism correctly assigns users to test groups.
   - Confirm that the system accurately measures and reports differences between test variations.

Success criteria should include:
- Achieving at least 15% higher re-engagement rate compared to non-targeted approaches.
- Demonstrating statistically significant improvement in conversion rates for targeted users.
- System performance meeting specified latency requirements (recommendations generated within 5 minutes of request).
- Dashboard providing clear visibility into targeting effectiveness metrics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Data Integration and Preprocessing Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a data pipeline that integrates with the User Behavior Analysis Module (Task 6) and Event Effect Analysis Module (Task 7) to collect, preprocess, and structure data for inactive user targeting.
### Details:
Create ETL processes to extract user activity data, engagement patterns, and conversion metrics from the User Behavior Analysis Module. Implement data connectors to pull event effectiveness data from the Event Effect Analysis Module. Design a data preprocessing pipeline that cleans, normalizes, and structures the combined dataset. Define 'inactivity' criteria based on business rules (e.g., no login for 30+ days). Create a unified data model that links user profiles with their historical behavior and response to past events. Implement data validation checks to ensure data quality and completeness.

## 2. Inactive User Segmentation Algorithm [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop algorithms to categorize inactive users into meaningful segments based on their historical behavior, spending patterns, and engagement history.
### Details:
Implement clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) to identify natural groupings of inactive users. Define feature engineering processes to extract relevant attributes from user data (e.g., past spending levels, engagement frequency before inactivity, social connections). Create segment definitions with clear criteria for each group (e.g., 'former whales', 'social players', 'weekend warriors'). Develop a segment assignment engine that classifies each inactive user into the appropriate segment. Implement a mechanism to periodically update segmentation as new data becomes available. Create segment profiles that summarize the characteristics of each segment for business users.

## 3. Predictive Re-engagement Model Development [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a machine learning model that predicts the probability of an inactive user responding to specific event types based on their segment and historical data.
### Details:
Develop feature vectors that combine user attributes, segment information, and historical event response data. Implement multiple prediction models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) to predict re-engagement probability. Create a separate model to predict conversion probability upon re-engagement. Implement model training pipelines with cross-validation to prevent overfitting. Develop model evaluation metrics focused on precision and recall for high-value users. Create a model selection framework to automatically choose the best performing model. Implement a model serving infrastructure to generate predictions in near real-time.

## 4. User Value Scoring and Ranking System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a scoring system that ranks inactive users by their potential value upon re-engagement, considering factors like previous spending, social influence, and predicted conversion probability.
### Details:
Define a comprehensive value scoring formula that incorporates: historical spending patterns, social network influence, predicted re-engagement probability, predicted conversion probability, and estimated lifetime value. Implement weighting mechanisms to balance different value components based on business priorities. Create a ranking algorithm that sorts inactive users by their potential value score. Develop a calibration mechanism to ensure score consistency across different user segments. Implement score visualization tools for business users to understand value distribution. Create an API endpoint to query top-ranked users for targeting campaigns.

## 5. Targeting Engine and Dashboard Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an automated targeting engine that matches high-potential inactive users with optimal event types, and create a dashboard for monitoring system effectiveness.
### Details:
Implement a matching algorithm that pairs high-value inactive users with the most effective event types for their segment. Create campaign generation tools that produce targeting lists for marketing systems. Develop an API for integration with existing notification and marketing platforms. Implement A/B testing capabilities within the targeting engine to continuously optimize matching rules. Create a comprehensive dashboard showing: re-engagement rates, conversion rates, ROI by segment, campaign effectiveness comparisons, and system health metrics. Implement alert mechanisms for unusual patterns or system issues. Ensure all implementations comply with data privacy regulations through appropriate anonymization and consent management.
