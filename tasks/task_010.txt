# Task ID: 10
# Title: Interactive Dashboard Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a framework for creating interactive dashboards using Flask and Dash to display analysis results and visualizations.
# Details:
The dashboard framework has been implemented with the following files:

1. src/visualization/inactive_event_dashboard.py - Dash-based dashboard framework and implementation
2. src/visualization/assets/dashboard.css - Dashboard styling
3. scripts/run_dashboard.py - Dashboard execution script

The current implementation provides:
- Dashboard initialization and layout management
- Data loading and processing
- Interactive filters and controls (sliders, buttons, etc.)
- Real-time data updates (callback functionality)
- Visualization components including graphs and tables
- Responsive layout

The InactiveUserEventDashboard class can be extended for various analysis dashboards.

Original planned structure was:
```python
class DashboardFramework:
    def __init__(self, report_generator, query_manager):
        self.report_generator = report_generator
        self.query_manager = query_manager
        self.app = self._initialize_app()
    
    def _initialize_app(self):
        # Initialize Flask and Dash application
        pass
    
    def add_page(self, page_name, layout_function):
        # Add page to dashboard
        pass
    
    def add_callback(self, outputs, inputs, state, callback_function):
        # Add interactive callback
        pass
    
    def create_filter_component(self, filter_type, data_source, **kwargs):
        # Create reusable filter component
        pass
    
    def create_visualization_component(self, viz_type, **kwargs):
        # Create visualization component
        pass
    
    def run_server(self, debug=False, port=8050):
        # Run dashboard server
        pass
```

Future enhancements could include:
- Creating a more generic base class from the InactiveUserEventDashboard implementation
- Adding more reusable components
- Implementing user authentication and session management
- Supporting multiple dashboard pages

# Test Strategy:
Create tests in tests/visualization/test_dashboard.py to verify:
- Proper initialization of Flask/Dash application
- Correct rendering of components
- Callback functionality
- Filter behavior

Test the existing implementation:
- Test the InactiveUserEventDashboard class functionality
- Verify data loading and processing
- Test interactive components like sliders and buttons
- Validate visualization rendering

Use mock data and test with headless browser for interaction testing.
