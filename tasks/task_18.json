  "title": "Inactive User Targeting System Development",
  "description": "Develop a system that identifies and targets inactive users with high potential for re-engagement and conversion through events, leveraging existing user behavior and event effect analysis modules.",
  "details": "This task involves creating a comprehensive system to identify and target inactive users who have a high probability of returning to the game and making deposits when presented with appropriate events. The system should:\n\n1. Integrate with the User Behavior Analysis Module (Task 6) to access historical user activity data, engagement patterns, and previous conversion metrics.\n2. Utilize the Event Effect Analysis Module (Task 7) to understand which events have been most effective for different user segments.\n3. Develop user segmentation algorithms that categorize inactive users based on their historical behavior, spending patterns, and engagement history.\n4. Create a predictive model that calculates the probability of an inactive user responding to specific event types.\n5. Implement a scoring system that ranks inactive users by their potential value upon re-engagement (considering factors like previous spending, social influence, etc.).\n6. Design an automated targeting mechanism that matches high-potential inactive users with the most effective event types for their segment.\n7. Develop a dashboard for monitoring the effectiveness of the targeting system, including metrics like re-engagement rate, conversion rate, and ROI.\n8. Implement A/B testing capabilities to continuously refine the targeting algorithms.\n9. Create an API for integration with existing marketing and notification systems.\n10. Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and implement appropriate data handling protocols.\n\nThe system should be designed with scalability in mind to handle large user databases and provide real-time or near-real-time targeting recommendations.",
  "testStrategy": "Testing for this system should be comprehensive and multi-faceted:\n\n1. Unit Testing:\n   - Test individual components of the system (segmentation algorithms, prediction models, scoring system) with known test data.\n   - Verify correct integration with Task 6 and Task 7 modules through mock interfaces.\n   - Validate the accuracy of the prediction models using historical data.\n\n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Ensure proper data flow between all components of the system.\n   - Verify that the system correctly retrieves and processes data from the User Behavior Analysis and Event Effect Analysis modules.\n   - Test the API endpoints for correct functionality and error handling.\n\n3. Performance Testing:\n   - Benchmark the system with large datasets to ensure it can handle the expected user base.\n   - Measure response times for generating targeting recommendations.\n   - Test the system under various load conditions to identify bottlenecks.\n\n4. Validation Testing:\n   - Conduct a controlled pilot test with a subset of inactive users to validate the effectiveness of the targeting system.\n   - Compare re-engagement and conversion rates between targeted users and a control group.\n   - Calculate the precision and recall of the prediction model using real-world results.\n\n5. User Acceptance Testing:\n   - Have marketing and product teams review the dashboard and targeting recommendations.\n   - Verify that the system provides actionable insights that align with business objectives.\n\n6. A/B Testing Framework Validation:\n   - Verify that the A/B testing mechanism correctly assigns users to test groups.\n   - Confirm that the system accurately measures and reports differences between test variations.\n\nSuccess criteria should include:\n- Achieving at least 15% higher re-engagement rate compared to non-targeted approaches.\n- Demonstrating statistically significant improvement in conversion rates for targeted users.\n- System performance meeting specified latency requirements (recommendations generated within 5 minutes of request).\n- Dashboard providing clear visibility into targeting effectiveness metrics.",
