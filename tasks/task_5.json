  "description": "Develop a module for executing SQL queries against the database with performance tracking, parameterization, and result management.",
  "details": "Create src/database/query_manager.py with functionality to:\n- Execute SQL queries with parameter binding\n- Measure and log query execution time\n- Handle query results (conversion to Pandas DataFrame, etc.)\n- Manage query templates and parameterization\n- Implement query caching for performance\n- Handle large result sets efficiently\n\nImplement the following structure:\n```python\nclass QueryManager:\n    def __init__(self, db_connection):\n        self.connection = db_connection\n        self.query_cache = {}\n        self.performance_log = []\n    \n    def execute_query(self, query, params=None, use_cache=True):\n        # Execute query with parameters\n        # Track execution time\n        # Return results as appropriate data structure\n        pass\n    \n    def execute_from_file(self, file_path, params=None):\n        # Load query from file and execute\n        pass\n    \n    def load_query_template(self, template_name):\n        # Load query template from queries directory\n        pass\n    \n    def get_performance_stats(self, query_pattern=None):\n        # Get performance statistics for queries\n        pass\n```\n\nOrganize SQL query files in the queries/ directory by category (user/, event/, schema/).",
  "testStrategy": "Create tests in tests/database/test_query_manager.py to verify:\n- Correct query execution and result handling\n- Parameter binding security (SQL injection prevention)\n- Performance tracking accuracy\n- Caching functionality\n- Large result set handling\nUse mock database responses for testing.",
