# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Structure Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the initial project structure according to the specified directory layout in the PRD.
# Details:
Create the directory structure as specified in section 5 of the PRD:
- Create main directories: docs/, src/, scripts/, data/, queries/, reports/, tests/
- Create subdirectories for each main directory
- Initialize Git repository
- Set up .gitignore file to exclude sensitive data and configuration files
- Create README.md with project overview
- Set up virtual environment for Python 3.9+
- Create requirements.txt file with initial dependencies (PyMySQL, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Flask, Dash)

# Test Strategy:
Verify all directories and files are created correctly. Run a script to check the structure matches the PRD specification. Ensure Git repository is initialized properly and virtual environment works.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Main Directory Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create all the main directories specified in the PRD section 5 and initialize Git repository.
### Details:
Create the following main directories: docs/, src/, scripts/, data/, queries/, reports/, tests/. Initialize a Git repository in the project root using 'git init'. Create a basic .gitignore file that excludes sensitive data, configuration files, virtual environment directories, and other common exclusions for Python projects.

## 2. Create Subdirectory Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create all required subdirectories within each main directory according to the file structure improvement plan.
### Details:
Based on the file_structure_improvement_plan.md, create appropriate subdirectories within each main directory. For example, src/ might contain subdirectories like models/, utils/, api/, etc. data/ might contain raw/, processed/, etc. Ensure all subdirectories mentioned in the improvement plan are created.

## 3. Create README Files [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create README.md files for the project root and each main directory to document their purpose and contents.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive README.md in the project root with sections for project overview, installation instructions, usage examples, and project structure. Create smaller README.md files in each main directory explaining the purpose of that directory and its contents. Follow the guidelines in file_structure_improvement_plan.md for content requirements.

## 4. Set Up Python Environment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a virtual environment and requirements.txt file with all necessary dependencies.
### Details:
Set up a Python virtual environment using Python 3.9+ with 'python -m venv venv' or similar. Create a requirements.txt file in the project root listing all required dependencies: PyMySQL, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Flask, Dash, and any other dependencies mentioned in the improvement plan. Include version specifications where appropriate.

## 5. Document Directory Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive documentation of the project structure in the docs directory.
### Details:
Create a detailed document in docs/ directory (e.g., project_structure.md) that explains the entire directory structure, the purpose of each directory and subdirectory, naming conventions, and file organization rules. Include diagrams if helpful. This document should serve as the definitive reference for the project structure and should align with the file_structure_improvement_plan.md.
