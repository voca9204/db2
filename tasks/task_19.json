  "title": "Implement Personalized Event Recommendation System for Inactive User Segments",
  "description": "Develop a system that analyzes user data to recommend optimal event types and reward sizes for different inactive user segments, providing personalized event recommendations to increase re-engagement and conversion rates.",
  "details": "The implementation should include the following components:\n\n1. Data Integration Layer:\n   - Connect to existing user activity history database\n   - Access previous event participation data\n   - Integrate payment history and purchase patterns\n   - Utilize the inactive user segmentation from Task #18\n\n2. Analysis Modules:\n   - User Preference Analysis: Identify patterns in past event participation and rewards that led to re-engagement\n   - Segment-specific Event Type Matching: Create algorithms to match event types to user segments based on historical performance\n   - Reward Size Optimization: Develop models to determine the optimal reward size that maximizes ROI for each segment\n   - ROI Prediction Model: Build predictive models to estimate the return on investment for different event-segment-reward combinations\n\n3. Recommendation Engine:\n   - Create a scoring system for ranking potential event recommendations\n   - Implement personalization algorithms that consider individual user history within segments\n   - Develop a recommendation API that can be called by other systems\n   - Include confidence scores with each recommendation\n\n4. System Integration:\n   - Connect with the Inactive User Targeting System from Task #18\n   - Integrate with existing event management systems\n   - Implement feedback loops to capture performance data for continuous improvement\n   - Create admin dashboard for monitoring and manual adjustments\n\n5. Performance Optimization:\n   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data\n   - Design batch processing for regular recommendation updates\n   - Ensure system can scale to handle the entire user base\n\n6. Documentation:\n   - Document all algorithms and data models\n   - Create API documentation for integration with other systems\n   - Provide usage guidelines for marketing teams",
  "testStrategy": "Testing should be comprehensive and include:\n\n1. Unit Testing:\n   - Test each analysis module independently with known test data\n   - Verify reward size optimization algorithms produce expected results\n   - Validate event type matching logic with historical data\n   - Test ROI prediction model accuracy against historical outcomes\n\n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Verify correct data flow between all system components\n   - Test integration with the Inactive User Targeting System (Task #18)\n   - Validate API endpoints return expected recommendation formats\n   - Ensure proper error handling when dependent systems fail\n\n3. Performance Testing:\n   - Benchmark system performance with large datasets\n   - Test recommendation generation time under various loads\n   - Verify system scalability with simulated user growth\n\n4. A/B Testing:\n   - Implement controlled experiments comparing:\n     - System recommendations vs. random event assignments\n     - System recommendations vs. human marketer selections\n     - Different versions of recommendation algorithms\n   - Measure key metrics: re-engagement rate, conversion rate, ROI\n\n5. Validation Testing:\n   - Back-testing: Apply the system to historical data and compare recommendations to actual outcomes\n   - Forward testing: Deploy recommendations to a small subset of users before full rollout\n   - Segment validation: Verify recommendations are appropriate for each user segment\n\n6. Acceptance Criteria:\n   - System must demonstrate at least 15% improvement in re-engagement rates compared to non-personalized approaches\n   - Recommendations must be generated within 500ms per user\n   - ROI predictions must achieve at least 80% accuracy when compared to actual results\n   - System must handle the entire inactive user base without performance degradation",
