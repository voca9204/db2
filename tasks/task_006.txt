# Task ID: 6
# Title: User Behavior Analysis Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a module to analyze user behavior patterns with a focus on inactive users, including activity levels, engagement metrics, and conversion rates.
# Details:
The module has been fully implemented in src/analysis/user/inactive_event_analyzer.py with the InactiveUserEventAnalyzer class. The implementation includes the following functionality:

1. User Activity Metrics:
   - Identify inactive users (get_inactive_users method) ✓
   - Calculate users who haven't played for specific periods ✓
   - Login frequency and session duration metrics (get_login_frequency(), get_session_duration() methods) ✓
   - Integrated activity metrics analysis (analyze_activity_metrics() method) ✓

2. User Engagement Patterns:
   - Analyze event participation patterns (get_event_participants method) ✓
   - Track deposit behavior after events (get_deposits_after_event method) ✓
   - Feature usage and content interaction analysis (get_feature_usage(), get_content_interaction() methods) ✓
   - Comprehensive user engagement analysis (analyze_user_engagement() method) ✓

3. Conversion Tracking:
   - Analyze conversion rates by inactive period (analyze_conversion_by_inactive_period method) ✓
   - Analyze conversion rates by event amount (analyze_conversion_by_event_amount method) ✓
   - General user journey funnel tracking (analyze_conversion_funnel() method) ✓

4. User Segmentation:
   - Segment inactive users based on inactivity duration ✓
   - Expanded segmentation based on behavior patterns (expand_user_segmentation() method) ✓
   - RFM analysis and behavior pattern-based segmentation ✓

5. Retention Analysis:
   - Cohort-based retention analysis (analyze_retention() method) ✓
   - Event-based retention analysis (analyze_event_retention() method) ✓
   - Retention and churn rate calculation and visualization ✓

All SQL queries for user analysis are stored in the queries/user/ directory.

# Test Strategy:
Tests have been implemented in tests/analysis/test_inactive_user_analyzer.py to verify:
- Correct identification of inactive users
- Proper event participation tracking
- Accurate conversion rate calculations by inactive period and event amount
- Proper segmentation of inactive users

Additional tests have been created in tests/analysis/test_user_behavior.py to verify:
- Correct calculation of additional activity metrics
- Proper funnel tracking for general user journeys
- Accurate segmentation for broader behavior patterns
- Retention calculation accuracy

A test script (scripts/tests/test_retention_analysis.py) has been created to facilitate easy testing of the new functionality.

All tests use sample datasets that include realistic inactive user scenarios and event participation data.
