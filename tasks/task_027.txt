# Task ID: 27
# Title: Task #27: Implement Database Integration for High-Value User Analysis Page
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect the high_value_users_report.html page to the actual database, replacing hardcoded sample data with real-time data including summary statistics for high-value users.
# Details:
This task involves several key implementation steps:

1. Review the current high_value_users_report.html page structure and identify all hardcoded data points that need to be replaced with actual database values.

2. Design and implement appropriate API endpoints to fetch the required data:
   - High-value user counts and lists
   - Active/dormant user ratios
   - User spending patterns and engagement metrics
   - Any other summary statistics currently displayed

3. Modify the frontend JavaScript to:
   - Make asynchronous calls to the new API endpoints
   - Handle loading states and potential errors gracefully
   - Format and display the returned data correctly
   - Implement proper data refresh mechanisms

4. Ensure the database queries are optimized for performance, especially considering potentially large datasets of high-value users.

5. Update any visualization components (charts, graphs) to work with the dynamic data structure rather than hardcoded values.

6. Implement proper error handling for cases where the database connection fails or returns unexpected data.

7. Add appropriate data caching mechanisms to prevent excessive database queries.

8. Document the API endpoints and data structures for future reference.

9. Coordinate with the Firebase Functions deployment process established in Task #24 to ensure proper integration.

The implementation should maintain all existing UI/UX elements while replacing the underlying data source with actual database connections.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be comprehensive and include:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Create unit tests for each API endpoint to verify correct data retrieval
   - Test edge cases such as empty results, large result sets, and error conditions
   - Verify calculation logic for summary statistics matches expected outcomes

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the complete flow from database to UI rendering
   - Verify all dynamic elements update correctly with different test datasets
   - Test performance under various load conditions

3. Manual Verification:
   - Compare the displayed data with direct database queries to ensure accuracy
   - Verify all summary statistics (high-value user counts, active/dormant ratios) match database calculations
   - Check that all charts and visualizations correctly reflect the actual data
   - Test the page with different user roles to ensure proper access controls

4. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure existing functionality remains intact
   - Verify that the page layout and design remain consistent with the original

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and document page load times with real data vs. hardcoded data
   - Identify any performance bottlenecks and optimize as needed
   - Test with various dataset sizes to ensure scalability

6. Documentation Verification:
   - Ensure all API endpoints are properly documented
   - Verify that data structures and relationships are clearly defined
   - Confirm that any new configuration parameters are documented

The task will be considered complete when all hardcoded data has been replaced with database-driven content, all tests pass, and the page performs efficiently with real-world data volumes.
