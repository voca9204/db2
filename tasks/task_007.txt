# Task ID: 7
# Title: Event Effect Analysis Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a module to analyze the effects of events on user behavior, including participation rates, ROI, and retention impact, with special focus on inactive users returning through events.
# Details:
The module has been implemented with the following components:

1. src/analysis/user/inactive_event_analyzer.py - Module for analyzing event effects on inactive users
2. src/visualization/inactive_event_dashboard.py - Dashboard for visualizing analysis results
3. scripts/analyze_inactive_events.py - Script for running the analysis
4. scripts/run_dashboard.py - Script for launching the dashboard

The implemented functionality includes:
- Identification of inactive users
- Analysis of event participation patterns
- Analysis of deposit behavior after events
- Conversion rate analysis by inactive period duration
- Conversion rate analysis by event value
- Visualization of analysis results and dashboard presentation

The original plan included creating src/analysis/event_effect.py with an EventEffectAnalyzer class, but the implementation evolved to focus specifically on inactive user analysis with a more comprehensive approach including visualization components.

# Test Strategy:
Tests have been implemented to verify:
- Correct identification of inactive users
- Accurate calculation of participation metrics
- Proper analysis of post-event deposit behavior
- Accurate conversion rate calculations by inactive period
- Accurate conversion rate calculations by event value
- Proper visualization of results
