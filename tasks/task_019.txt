# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Personalized Event Recommendation System for Inactive User Segments
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system that analyzes user data to recommend optimal event types and reward sizes for different inactive user segments, providing personalized event recommendations to increase re-engagement and conversion rates.
# Details:
The implementation should include the following components:

1. Data Integration Layer:
   - Connect to existing user activity history database
   - Access previous event participation data
   - Integrate payment history and purchase patterns
   - Utilize the inactive user segmentation from Task #18

2. Analysis Modules:
   - User Preference Analysis: Identify patterns in past event participation and rewards that led to re-engagement
   - Segment-specific Event Type Matching: Create algorithms to match event types to user segments based on historical performance
   - Reward Size Optimization: Develop models to determine the optimal reward size that maximizes ROI for each segment
   - ROI Prediction Model: Build predictive models to estimate the return on investment for different event-segment-reward combinations

3. Recommendation Engine:
   - Create a scoring system for ranking potential event recommendations
   - Implement personalization algorithms that consider individual user history within segments
   - Develop a recommendation API that can be called by other systems
   - Include confidence scores with each recommendation

4. System Integration:
   - Connect with the Inactive User Targeting System from Task #18
   - Integrate with existing event management systems
   - Implement feedback loops to capture performance data for continuous improvement
   - Create admin dashboard for monitoring and manual adjustments

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Design batch processing for regular recommendation updates
   - Ensure system can scale to handle the entire user base

6. Documentation:
   - Document all algorithms and data models
   - Create API documentation for integration with other systems
   - Provide usage guidelines for marketing teams

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be comprehensive and include:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test each analysis module independently with known test data
   - Verify reward size optimization algorithms produce expected results
   - Validate event type matching logic with historical data
   - Test ROI prediction model accuracy against historical outcomes

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify correct data flow between all system components
   - Test integration with the Inactive User Targeting System (Task #18)
   - Validate API endpoints return expected recommendation formats
   - Ensure proper error handling when dependent systems fail

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark system performance with large datasets
   - Test recommendation generation time under various loads
   - Verify system scalability with simulated user growth

4. A/B Testing:
   - Implement controlled experiments comparing:
     - System recommendations vs. random event assignments
     - System recommendations vs. human marketer selections
     - Different versions of recommendation algorithms
   - Measure key metrics: re-engagement rate, conversion rate, ROI

5. Validation Testing:
   - Back-testing: Apply the system to historical data and compare recommendations to actual outcomes
   - Forward testing: Deploy recommendations to a small subset of users before full rollout
   - Segment validation: Verify recommendations are appropriate for each user segment

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - System must demonstrate at least 15% improvement in re-engagement rates compared to non-personalized approaches
   - Recommendations must be generated within 500ms per user
   - ROI predictions must achieve at least 80% accuracy when compared to actual results
   - System must handle the entire inactive user base without performance degradation
